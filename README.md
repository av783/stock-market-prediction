📊 Stock Market Prediction Model

📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a machine learning-based approach to predict stock market trends using historical data. The goal is to analyze past stock movements, extract insights, and build a model that can forecast potential future prices.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Language: Python

Environment: Jupyter Notebook

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

🚀 Workflow

Data Collection – Load stock market data.

Data Preprocessing – Clean and prepare the dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identify trends and patterns.

Feature Engineering – Generate useful input features.

Model Training – Apply machine learning algorithms.

Evaluation – Assess prediction accuracy with metrics.

Visualization – Plot actual vs predicted stock prices.

📈 Results

Built a predictive model for stock price trends.

Gained insights into market behavior through visualizations.

Established a baseline for future improvement with deep learning models.
